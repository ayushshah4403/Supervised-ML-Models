# Supervised-ML-Models

Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.

Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).

Supervised learning can be further divided into two types of problems:

1. Regression

   Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable.

2. Classification

   Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, True-false, etc.

Classification Models implemented in this Repository are:
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
